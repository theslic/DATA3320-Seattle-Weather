# DATA3320 Seattle & St. Louis Weather
The purpose of the project is to get started with Python and using pandas to clean our data to make it easier to work with
and to learn about the different ways to visualize data though tables and other forms of visualizations.
We got the data from https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320 which is our professor's data files that we will be using.
These were taken from an other online source NOAA site: https://www.noaa.gov/. The files seattle_rain.csv and stl_rain.csv are datasets on rainfall.  

Technology: jyupter notebook  

Data Preparation - Li_DATA_3320_Seattle_St_Louis_Data_Preparation.ipynb  
To clean the data I first looked for the columns I was most interested in such as date and precipitation.
Then I checked for any missing or invalid values, once discovering them I imputed them using the mean for that
day across all the years, now not affecting my calculation as much. I also joined the tables on the date and precipitation
columns. Then I created a new column to the dataframe that would be true or false wether the precipitation for that day was
0 or not. This column 'zero_precip' is whether it rained that day or not as a boolean. Now the new cleaned data is a table with the day, month, year, precipitation, city, and zero_precip. The file with the data is: clean_seattle_stl_weather.csv
