# DATA3320-Seattle-Weather
The purpose of the project is to get started with Python and using pandas to clean our data to make it easier to work with
and to learn about the different ways to visualize data though tables and other forms of visualizations.
We got the data from https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320 which is our professor's data files that we will be using.
These were taken from an other online source NOAA site.
seattle_rain.csv and stl_rain.csv are datasets on rainfall.
